# Visuals Description

The Bakery Story dashboard is a single-page Power BI report (with tooltip and drillthrough support) built to help players make smarter, faster baking decisions. Every visual on the page responds dynamically to your custom preferences, whether you're chasing fast cash, XP, or chill, low-maintenance batches.

It‚Äôs clean, interactive, and a little nerdy ‚Äî just how we like it.

## üßÅ Main View

This is the heart of the report. It‚Äôs where you explore recipe efficiency based on what *you* care about.

### Layout Overview

- **Slider Panel (Disconnected Slicers)**  
  - Profit, Cook Time, Servings, XP  
  - Each slider adjusts how important the metric is (‚Äì4 to +4)

  - 0 means ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care,‚Äù negative means ‚Äúpenalize‚Äù

- **Cook Time Range Selector**  
  - A numeric range slicer to limit the recipe pool  
  - Helps you say ‚Äújust show me things that take around 4 hours,‚Äù etc.

- **Appliance Filter**  
  - Multi-select list of every appliance in the game  
  - Only see what‚Äôs cookable with your current setup

## ü™Ñ Tooltip Panel (Hover Preview)

When you hover over a bar in the main chart, you‚Äôll see a pop-up showing the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind that recipe‚Äôs score.

This tooltip includes:

| Field                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Efficiency Score** | Final result after all weights applied |
| **Total Profit**     | Raw profit before normalization |
| **Normalized Profit**| Value scaled relative to other recipes |
| **Total Cook Minutes** | How long it takes, end-to-end |
| **Normalized Cook Time** | Scaled cook time |
| **Total Servings**   | How many dishes it produces |
| **Normalized Servings** | Scaled servings |
| **Total XP**         | Experience gained |
| **Normalized XP**    | Scaled XP value |

The tooltip helps users understand what‚Äôs boosting or dragging each score ‚Äî without leaving the chart. It‚Äôs especially useful when weights are extreme and the chart shifts dramatically.

> Think of it like a recipe r√©sum√©: here‚Äôs why this one ranks how it does.

## üîé Drillthrough Page (Deep Dive)

This is where you can **zoom in** on a single recipe after clicking it in the main chart.

Once a recipe is selected, the drillthrough page shows:

| Insight | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Profit per Minute** | Speed-to-income ratio ‚Äî how fast does this earn? |
| **XP per Minute** | How much leveling juice you get per hour |
| **Servings per Minute** | Tells you how quickly a batch clears out |
| **Profit per Serving** | What each plate is worth |
| **XP per Serving** | Bonus points per customer served |
| **Total Stats** | Raw numbers for profit, servings, XP, cook time |
| **Normalized Stats** | The same values scaled between 0 and 1 for fair comparison |

Planned visuals:

- Small KPI cards for each of the per-minute/per-serving ratios  
- A radar chart showing relative strengths across Profit, Time, XP, and Servings  
- A visual indicator of how close this recipe is to the ‚Äúbest fit‚Äù based on your weights

> This page is all about context. You found a top recipe ‚Äî now let‚Äôs explore *why* it works, and how it stacks up in every category.
