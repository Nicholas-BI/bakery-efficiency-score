# Power Query Overview

This section documents the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) layer for the **Bakery Story** report. All transformations were authored using Power Query (M) in Power BI Desktop and follow a modular, sourceâ€‘toâ€‘dimension/fact structure.

---

## Query Layers

Queries are organized into three logical tiers:

### ðŸ”¹ Source and Base Queries
- `base_data.txt` â€“ Raw game export containing all Bakery Story events, filtered to the target date range and trimmed to core columns.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Fact Tables
- `fact_sales.txt` â€“ Consolidated inâ€‘game sales transactions, revenue, and XP earned, built from `base_data`.  
- `fact_production.txt` â€“ Bake cycle durations, ingredient usage, and oven utilization metrics derived from `base_data`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Dimension Tables
- `dim_recipe.txt` â€“ Distinct recipes with ingredient mappings, category tags, and cooking parameters.  
- `dim_ingredient.txt` â€“ Ingredient metadata including cost, category, and package size.  
- `dim_customer.txt` â€“ Player/customer segmentation attributes and behavior flags.  
- `dim_oven.txt` â€“ Oven/machine characteristics, performance ratings, and upgrade levels.  
- `dim_shop.txt` â€“ Bakery shop metadata such as region, tier, and layout configuration.

## Query Dependency Structure

The diagram below illustrates how source queries flow into fact and dimension tables:

This clear separation of responsibilities promotes maintainability, performance, and ease of debugging.

## Available M Code

Each `.txt` file in this folder contains the full M code used to generate its corresponding table:

- [base_data.txt](./base_data.txt)  
- [fact_sales.txt](./fact_sales.txt)  
- [fact_production.txt](./fact_production.txt)  
- [dim_recipe.txt](./dim_recipe.txt)  
- [dim_ingredient.txt](./dim_ingredient.txt)  
- [dim_customer.txt](./dim_customer.txt)  
- [dim_oven.txt](./dim_oven.txt)  
- [dim_shop.txt](./dim_shop.txt)  

> _Note: Filenames and descriptions above are placeholdersâ€”adjust to match your actual query names._

## Notes and Conventions

- **Early Typing**: All date/time fields are cast to `datetime` at the source layer to ensure relationship integrity.  
- **Consistent Keys**: Primary keys (e.g., `RecipeID`, `IngredientID`, `OvenID`, `ShopID`) are explicitly cast to prevent schema mismatches.  
- **Descriptive Steps**: Each transformation step uses meaningful names to aid readability and debugging.  
- **Sourceâ€‘Level Cleanup**: Perform cleansing, filtering, and type conversions as early as possible to keep downstream logic lean.
