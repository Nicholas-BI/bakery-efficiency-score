# ðŸ”§ Power Query Overview

This report's ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was built entirely in Power BI using Power Query (M). All transformations follow a modular, layered structure to ensure clarity, reusability, and maintainability.

## Query Structure

The Power Query layer is organized into three tiers:

### Source and Base Queries

- `Base_BakeryData` â€” Raw recipe-level data loaded from the source `.xlsx` file. Columns are typed early, trimmed to essentials, and cleaned for consistency.

---

### Fact Table

- `Fact_Bakery` â€” Core metrics used in scoring and ranking, including cook time, servings, income, cost, XP, and calculated profit. Built from the cleaned base data.

---

### Dimension Tables

- `Dim_Recipe` â€” Static recipe attributes, such as name, category, and cook time.  
- `Dim_Appliance` â€” Appliance metadata used for filtering and axis switching.  
- `Metrics` â€” Helper table listing the four core scoring metrics.  
- `Axis Field Selector` â€” Enables toggling between different chart axes.  
- `Measure Table` â€” Used for dynamic measure selection in slicers or tooltips.

## Design Principles

The Power Query transformations follow a consistent pattern:

- **Early Typing**: Date and numeric fields are typed at the source step to prevent type errors downstream.  
- **Clean Output Layer**: All data modeling columns are finalized in the `Fact_Bakery` output table, with no additional transformations needed in DAX.  
- **Descriptive Steps**: Each applied step is named clearly to support self-documenting code.  
- **Minimized Redundancy**: Shared logic appears only once, with no repeated calculations between tables.

## Available M Code

Full transformation logic is available in the following files:

- [`Base_BakeryData.txt`](./docs/Base_BakeryData.txt)  
- [`Fact_Bakery.txt`](./docs/Fact_Bakery.txt)  
- [`Dim_Recipe.txt`](./docs/Dim_Recipe.txt)  
- [`Dim_Appliance.txt`](./docs/Dim_Appliance.txt)  
- [`Metrics.txt`](./docs/Metrics.txt)  
- [`Axis_Field_Selector.txt`](./docs/Axis_Field_Selector.txt)  
- [`Measure_Table.txt`](./docs/Measure_Table.txt)

Each file contains the raw M code for its corresponding query.
