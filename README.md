# üç∞ Bakery Story: Recipe Efficiency Report (Power BI)

A Power BI report that ranks *Bakery Story* recipes based on what *you* value‚ÄîProfit, Cook Time, Servings, and XP. Use dynamic sliders and an exponent-based scoring model built on ratio-normalized metrics to customize the rankings in real time.

---

## What‚Äôs the Game?

*Bakery Story* is a mobile sim where you run a bakery‚Äîcooking, serving, earning coins, and leveling up. Recipes vary in cook time, servings, profit, and XP. Appliances are limited, and customers arrive steadily.

Which recipe is *best*? That depends on your goals.

## Why I Made This

A debate with my partner, Stephanie‚Äîshe liked low-maintenance bakes; I wanted fast profits. This report lets you decide what matters and adapts accordingly.

---

## What It Does

Ranks recipes based on your priorities with instant updates.

**Features:**
- Sliders for Profit, Cook Time, Servings, XP  
- Preset strategies (*Quick Cash*, *XP Farm*, etc.)  
- Appliance filters, cook-time caps  
- Context-aware DAX logic and transparent scoring  
- Tooltips, bookmarks, and exportable measures

## How It Works

A responsive scoring model using:

- **Ratio-normalized metrics** (shifted to [1‚Äì2])  
- **Exponent weighting** for nonlinear influence  
- **Dynamic DAX** that adapts to filters and slicers

---

## Scoring Logic

1. Normalize each metric to [1‚Äì2]  
2. Apply user-defined exponents  
3. Multiply preferred metrics, divide by penalized  
4. Rank by resulting score in current context
