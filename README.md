# Bakery Story: Recipe Efficiency Score (Power BI)

A Power BI report that helps you find the best recipes in *Bakery Story* based on what *you* care about. Customize real-time rankings with interactive sliders and a nonlinear scoring model built on ratio-normalized metrics.

## Whatâ€™s the Game?

In *Bakery Story*, youâ€™re running a virtual bakery focused on cooking, serving, leveling up, and trying to make the most of limited appliances.

Each recipe has tradeoffs: cook time, servings, XP, profit. So... whatâ€™s the *best* recipe?

This report lets you decide.

## Why I Built This

After a spirited debate with my partner (low effort vs. high yield), I built this to settle the scoreâ€”and make the whole strategy more transparent.

Now you can adjust the weights and *see* how different goals impact the rankings.

## What It Tracks

**Dynamic recipe rankings based on your input:**
- Sliders for Profit, Cook Time, Servings, and XP  
- Preset strategies (Quick Cash, XP Farm, etc.)  
- Appliance and cook-time filters  
- Nonlinear exponent-based scoring  
- Full logic exposed in tooltips

## Try It

1. Download ðŸ”— [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop)  
2. Download ðŸ“¥ [bakery_story.pbix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nicholas-BI/bakery-efficiency-score/main/docs/data/bakery_story.pbix) 
3. Tweak sliders and explore strategies  
4. Review tooltips and scoring logic

## How It Works

Each recipeâ€™s score is calculated in four steps:

1. Total up raw values  
2. Normalize each metric to the [0â€“1] range  
3. Apply user-selected exponents (from sliders)
4. Raise values to those weights
5. Multiply weighted metrics, divide by penalized ones  
6. Rank all results in real time

## Preset Strategies

Each strategy applies a different weighting profile:

| Strategy     | Profit | Cook Time | Servings | XP | Description                    |
|--------------|--------|-----------|----------|----|--------------------------------|
| Quick Cash   | 20     | â€“20       | â€“5       | 1  | Maximize profit, minimize time |
| XP Farm      | 5      | â€“20       | â€“5       | 20 | Fast XP with short bakes       |
| Party Host   | 1      |   0       | 20       | 1  | Max servings for events        |
| Balanced     | 2      | â€“1        | -1       | 2  | Well-rounded optimization      |
