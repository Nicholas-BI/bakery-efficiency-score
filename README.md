# Power BI: Bakery Story Efficiency Score

This Power BI project models product efficiency in the mobile game *Bakery Story*. Users can rank recipes based on customizable criteria such as profit, cooking time, servings, and experience (XP) gained. Weight sliders let players express their playstyle prioritiesâ€”whether chasing fast cash, XP, or passive incomeâ€”and dynamically re-rank recipes in real time.

## Project Overview

This report helps *Bakery Story* players optimize their gameplay by comparing recipe efficiency under different playstyle preferences. Users assign weights to key metricsâ€”Profit, Cook Time, Servings, XPâ€”and instantly see a ranked list of recipes based on their priorities. All calculations are normalized and dynamic.

---

## Key Features

- Fully dynamic weighting system via slicers  
- Bookmark presets for different playstyles (e.g. Quick Cash, XP Farm)  
- Real-time recipe ranking by user preferences  
- Interactive tooltips and supporting visuals  
- Exponent-based scaling for greater differentiation  
- Ratio-based normalization to preserve relative performance

---

## Data Model Overview

The model is based on a single fact table with supporting What-If parameter tables:

- **Fact Tables:**  
  - `Fact_Bakery` â€“ One row per recipe with attributes for profit, XP, servings, and time  

- **Weight Tables:**  
  - `ProfitWeight`, `CookTimeWeight`, `ServingsWeight`, `XPWeight` â€“ Disconnected What-If tables for user-selected weights  

- **Utility Tables:**  
  - `TimePeriods` (for filtering scenarios or presets)  
  - `Calendar` (basic date table, if time logic is used)  

> See [ðŸ“„ Data Model Description](./docs/data_model_description.md)

## Report Pages

The report includes a single interactive dashboard with weight sliders, bookmark buttons, and a ranked bar chart of recipes.

- **Main Page**  
  - Weight sliders for Profit, Cook Time, Servings, XP  
  - Preset buttons for common playstyles  
  - Recipe table and bar chart ranked by dynamic Efficiency Score  
  - Tooltips showing breakdowns and normalized scores  

> See [ðŸ“„ Visuals Walkthrough](./docs/visuals_description.md)

## DAX Strategy

This report uses a **modular DAX architecture** built around user-adjustable logic. Instead of hardcoded priorities, the ranking logic is driven by relative importance via exponent-weighted scores.

### Measure Structure:

- **Base Measures**  
  - `Total Profit`, `Total XP`, `Total Cook Minutes`, `Total Servings`

- **Normalized Measures**  
  - Ratio-based calculations (e.g., `Normalized Profit = Profit / Max Profit`)  

- **Exponent Scaled**  
  - Each normalized value is raised to the user-defined weight power  
  - Positive weights emphasize high values  
  - Negative weights penalize high values (flip to denominator)

- **Efficiency Score**  
  - Score = (Product of all positively-weighted terms) Ã· (Product of negatively-weighted terms)

## Power Query & ETL

Recipe data is derived from in-game values (profit, XP, servings, time), entered manually for modeling purposes. Power Query is used for basic cleanup, typing, and shaping into a single fact table.

> [ðŸ“· Query Dependencies](./images/power_query/query_dependencies.png)

---

## Data Privacy

All recipe data is sourced from publicly available in-game information. No sensitive or proprietary data is included.

---

## Technologies Used

- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Power Query (M)  
- Excel (for initial entry)  
- GitHub for documentation

## Purpose

This report is part of a personal portfolio to demonstrate:

- A fully interactive, player-guided efficiency model  
- Use of What-If slicers to parameterize logic  
- Ratio-based normalization and exponent scaling  
- Dynamic DAX for non-business use cases  
- Clear, communicative reporting for a casual audience
